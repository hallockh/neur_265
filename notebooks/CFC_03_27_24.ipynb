Cross-frequency coupling been observed in many brain regions, has been shown to change in time with task demands, and has been proposed to serve a [functional role]('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359652/') in working memory, neuronal computation, communication, and learning. Although the cellular and dynamic mechanisms of specific rhythms associated with CFC are relatively well understood, the mechanisms governing interactions between different frequency rhythms - and the appropriate techniques for measuring CFC - remain active research areas. Although we consider only a single electrode recording here, we note that these techniques can be extended to association measures between electrodes as well.\n",
